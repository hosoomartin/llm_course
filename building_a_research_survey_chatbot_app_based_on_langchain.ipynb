These generative agents are designed to behave based on past experience and interact with other agents. Additionally, LLMs can be fine-tuned to use external tool APIs, allowing them to perform specific tasks or access external resources. Examples of LLM apps include ChatGPT Plugins, OpenAI API function calling, and HuggingGPT, which acts as a task planner for selecting models and summarizing responses. The effectiveness of LLMs in performing tasks depends on their capability to extract the right arguments and knowing when and how to use external tools. \n",
